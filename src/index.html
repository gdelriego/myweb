            <h4>Full Stack Developer!</h4>
            <p>
                With an 8-year tenure in the professional realm, my career began in a distinctively different field as a surf instructor, a role that honed my leadership, patience, and instructional skills.
                This unique background has provided me with a diverse perspective and a robust foundation in team dynamics and motivation.
                Three years ago, I transitioned into the world of programming, where I have since immersed myself in a wide range of technologies across various companies.
                My foray into artificial intelligence, specifically within computer vision, has seen me work extensively with OpenCV (CV2) and YoLoV4, demonstrating my capability to leverage advanced tools for sophisticated technological solutions.
                Complementing this expertise, I have developed proficiency in Selenium for testing, ensuring the reliability and efficiency of the applications I work on.
                In the recent two years, my focus has shifted towards a significant engagement with Airbus's Skywise platform through the Foundry program.
                Here, I have assumed critical roles in web application development using Slate and in data management within the Code Repository.
                My work involves a diverse array of programming languages and technologies, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, PySpark, and SQL, evidencing my adaptability and broad technical skill set.
                My rapid learning abilities and a keen interest in facing challenges have been a constant throughout my career.
                Transitioning from surf instruction to programming, I have continuously sought to expand my knowledge and skills, proving my versatility and commitment to growth and innovation in the tech sector.
